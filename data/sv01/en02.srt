1
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,348
...Holy shit.

2
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,101
What the fuck is that?

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,354
Uh, that is Jared Dunn.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,022
He works for Gavin Belson.

5
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,486
Hey. Sorry if I scared you.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,864
I know I have somewhat ghost-like features.

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,326
My uncle used to say, "You look like
someone starved a virgin to death."

8
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,495
it's... Yeah. I can see it.

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,579
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,834
I heard you were having a launch party.

11
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,670
- Yeah.
- Am I early?

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,213
No.

13
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,760
Well, then a gift of congratulations.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,262
Now if Gavin sent you here,

15
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,805
you should know that I've turned him down.

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,889
I'm going with Peter Gregory.

17
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,474
I'm actually picking up my check tomorrow.

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,851
So I've made my decision.

19
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,478
That's not why I'm here. it's just...

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,649
Watching you say no to $10 million
to build your own thing,

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,360
there's just something
very exciting about that.

22
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,988
Whoa. Whoa, whoa! What is he doing here?

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,824
Hey, this is a private party, buddy.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,368
- Oh, I didn't mean to...
- You know, in the state of California

25
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,329
you can kill a man for entering
your house without permission.

26
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,999
Okay. I understand. Thank you.

27
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,292
Oh.

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,310
Richard, I just wanna say,
I really respect what you're doing here.

29
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,091
And if you could ever use someone
with my business-development skill set,

30
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,719
- I would love to be a part of this.
- The fuck you will be.

31
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,305
We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.

32
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,437
You know this is a fucking domestic?

33
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,189
Why were you so mean to him?

34
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,566
He wasn't spying on us.
He just said he likes us.

35
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,777
- He wants to join the company.
- Of course he does, Richard.

36
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,153
Let me explain something to you.

37
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,655
Your whole life you've been an ugly chick,

38
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,949
but now suddenly you're a hot chick,

39
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,951
with big tits and small nipples.

40
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,877
So guys like that
are gonna keep coming around.

41
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,497
Don't be a slut, Richard.

42
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:03,956
- I don't...

43
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,793
Now speaking of such things,

44
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,128
Dinesh, change the lighting
to something erotic

45
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,757
because it's about to get
pretty fucking erotic in here.

46
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,552
License to Kill-9. lBAction-dot-Erotica.

47
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,138
What... What's going on?

48
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,433
- What's happening?
- Gentlemen, I present to you

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,102
Mochacino.

50
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,813
Not this guy.

51
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:28,773
Mochacino.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,068
She's my gift to you.

53
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,532
You wanna smoke weed?

54
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,747
Um...

55
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,292
Hey.

56
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,545
Can somebody play something
with a beat, please?

57
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,755
I'll go make a playlist.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,217
Yeah. I actually have
some water cooking, I think.

59
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,143
Yeah, I don't pay for it, so

60
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,063
barking up the wrong tree here.

61
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,816
God, I hate Palo Alto.

62
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,372
Hello again.

63
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,124
You know, I don't actually have
a ton of dance music,

64
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,368
but I turned the bass way up.

65
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,043
Baby,

66
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,628
you're getting a private show.

67
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,214
Hey.

68
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,966
What the fuck?

69
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,926
Okay. There's the butt time.

70
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,097
Should we have left him
in there by himself?

71
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,432
Should we go back in there?

72
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,059
No interest. I entice the flesh,
I don't pay for it.

73
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,853
Plus, Tara's coming into town
in a couple of weeks.

74
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,646
I'm saving up all my humors for her.

75
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,023
You know what I mean?

76
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,941
- What's your excuse?
- I didn't even shake

77
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,736
a woman's hand until I was 17 years old.

78
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,239
The idea of getting an erection
around men I live and work with,

79
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,367
it's just not something I can handle.

80
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,578
The idea that I have a boner
and you have a boner

81
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,954
and he has a boner and
we're all sitting there

82
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,539
with boners in our pants...

83
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,750
I wonder if he's okay in there.

84
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,628
So what do you guys do here?

85
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,089
Oh, we're mostly working on
a lossless compression algorithm.

86
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,092
- A what?
- Lt makes files smaller.

87
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,802
Doesn't matter. it's called Pied Piper.

88
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,347
It's gonna be famous.
You'll know it, eventually.

89
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,327
Who was this woman that you shook
hands with for the first time?

90
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,852
The postman lady.

91
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,104
- What?
- A woman that was a man?

92
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,315
Not a post-man lady.

93
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,609
- A lady who was a post...
- Let me ask you another question.

94
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,653
Who was the second woman
you shook hands with?

95
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,820
I didn't even know
you were coming.

96
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,322
- Stop. Doug!
- Oh, boy.

97
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,032
- Stop.
- I'm the one...

98
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,117
Someone is paying me. Okay? I didn't come

99
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,495
just to dance on your
boner all night for free.

100
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,957
I was not erect. That was...
l was only being polite.

101
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,667
So you were being polite when
you said that you loved me?

102
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,503
First off, I said you seemed
like someone I could fall in love with.

103
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,213
And, yes, also politeness.

104
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,673
Richie, pay the lady.

105
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,300
What? Why should I pay her?

106
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,345
I didn't hire her. I didn't
even get a lap dance.

107
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,638
This is a company party
and you're the CEO, so pony up.

108
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,890
No. if anyone should pay her,
it should be you.

109
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,977
Doug, help the CEO find his money.

110
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,354
No. No, no. We don't need help.

111
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,689
I know where it is. it's here.

112
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,107
- It's all here.
Mmm-hmm.

113
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,733
I don't know... Do you accept AMEX?

114
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,528
- You damn right I do.
- Put 100 on there for yourself, Mocha.

115
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,363
Oh. Well, that's an expensive boner.

116
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,447
Not a boner.

117
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,702
Thanks for coming in, guys.

118
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,747
We have a lot to do, so let's get started.

119
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,374
Sounds great.

120
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,634
Me? Okay.

121
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,094
Uh...

122
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:51,100
Well, we're just really excited
to get going, Mr. Gregory.

123
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,519
Yes. Who's "we"?

124
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,688
Myself, him,

125
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,315
- uh, the guys back at the house.
- Guys?

126
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,943
What guys?

127
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,446
Who is this?

128
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,781
Erlich Bachman. I'm an entrepreneur,

129
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,116
much like yourself.

130
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,325
Uh...

131
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,412
Richard actually developed Pied Piper

132
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,997
while residing in my incubator,

133
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,751
so as per our agreement,
I own 10% of the company.

134
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm paying you $200,000 for 5%,

135
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,463
yet you're giving this man

136
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,425
twice that in exchange for a futon

137
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,969
and some sandwiches?

138
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,889
Actually, sir, my tenants
provide their own food.

139
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,693
What other percentages
have you apportioned?

140
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,811
Can I see your cap table,
investment deck,

141
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,773
business plan,
or any other relevant paperwork

142
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,733
you may have prepared?

143
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,236
I just was under the impression that

144
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,740
we would just be coming by
and saying, "Hi," you know, uh,

145
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,450
to pick up the check.

146
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,620
And I just didn't know that
any of that stuff was due yet.

147
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,829
"Due"?

148
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,709
This is not college, Richard.

149
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,587
I am not going to be
giving you a course syllabus.

150
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,674
You turned down $10 million
to keep Pied Piper.

151
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,970
What did you give up that money for?
What is this company?

152
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,139
What did I buy?

153
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,725
- You bought the algorithm, which...
- No.

154
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,438
The algorithm is the
product of the company.

155
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,523
I know that.

156
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,067
What I'm asking about
is the company itself.

157
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,486
Who is it? What do they do?

158
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,321
Are they essential?

159
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,950
Or do you just throw a percentage at them,
like you did with this...

160
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,750
This all must be worked out.

161
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,252
Now.

162
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,923
When you said you'd guide us

163
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,050
through some of this stuff,
I thought that this was

164
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,760
the stuff you'd be guiding us through.

165
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,556
I cannot guide you until you give me

166
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,892
something to guide.

167
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,063
This is going very poorly.

168
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,400
- I know.
- He doesn't seem to know what he's doing.

169
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,365
Did you just take a sip from an empty cup?

170
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,659
Yes.

171
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,910
Why did you do that?

172
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,415
- Just something to do.
- Come back in 48 hours

173
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,167
with an airtight business plan,

174
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,460
a clear go-to-market strategy,

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,882
and three-year summary P&L,
or there will be no check.

176
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,721
That's it.

177
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,265
Thanks for coming in, guys.

178
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,393
Um...

179
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,812
Are there any water
fountains in your offices?

180
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,772
I assume.

181
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,443
I own 10% of an app
that locates all nearby water fountains.

182
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,819
I'd be happy to discuss it with you.

183
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,654
Good day, gentlemen.

184
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,990
You smoke weed?

185
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,371
You really embarrassed me in there.

186
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,957
You didn't say shit about
any business plan before today.

187
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,683
And neither did he. And he was
kind of being an asshole back there.

188
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,045
Yeah, that's why he's a billionaire.

189
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,930
'Cause he knows how
and when to be an asshole.

190
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,006
That's what you need to be like.

191
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,883
- You do, Richard.
- Whatever.

192
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,637
If you continue to mismanage this company,
giving 10% to whoever...

193
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,056
Obviously, you know,
we can't go back on my shares.

194
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,350
That ship has sailed,
but from here on out...

195
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,143
Now you're being an asshole.

196
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,811
You say that like it's a bad thing.

197
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,260
Richard, if you're not an asshole,
it creates this kind of

198
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:29,735
asshole vacuum and that void
is filled by other assholes, like Jared.

199
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,487
I mean, you almost gave him shares.

200
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,740
You need to completely
change who you are, Richard.

201
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,201
A complete Teutonic shift has to happen.

202
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,329
- Tectonic.
- What?

203
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,832
A "tectonic" shift is
the Earth's crust moving around.

204
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,085
"Teutonic," which is what you just said,

205
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,879
is an ancient Germanic tribe
that fought the Romans.

206
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,590
They were originally from Scandinavia...

207
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,592
Stop it! Stop it.

208
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,595
You're being a complete tool right now.

209
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,056
I need you to be a complete asshole.

210
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,891
Do you understand the difference?

211
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,018
If you're not an asshole,
this company dies.

212
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,271
Erlich, I have 48 hours.

213
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,598
Are you going to help me
with this business plan or not?

214
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,277
I believe in you, Richard.
That's why I'm not.

215
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,034
"Business plans that are created
in support of new ventures

216
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,705
"or to implement profound
changes in existing venture."

217
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,219
Hi, this is Richard Hendricks.

218
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,263
Ls now a good time?

219
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,099
Uh, I need some help.

220
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,272
Whose Chevy Volt is that out front?

221
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,982
Jared Dunn's.

222
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,234
What? Why? Why is he here?

223
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,071
Well, because, as you know,
I need some advice on the business plan.

224
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,406
You're cutting him in?

225
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,575
Um...

226
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,956
Good morning. Whoops, that was weird.

227
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,875
I don't know why I did that.

228
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,086
You kind of have a...
Like a king-ish feeling to you.

229
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,922
You're like a Norse hero from Valhalla.

230
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,215
Don't pander to me.

231
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,760
Peter Gregory said
specifically to trim the fat.

232
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,596
They actually tried to diagnose me
with a wasting disease

233
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,348
because of my slender frame.

234
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:27,269
So, um, I ironed out
our customer acquisition strategy,

235
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:31,315
and I wrapped our financials.
I did a DCF valuation.

236
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,235
Most VCs can't even do that math,
but something tells me Peter is different.

237
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,447
I think we can jump into
the one-on-ones with each team member

238
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,616
- to see if I can defend our cap table.
- Okay.

239
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,036
But first, if you don't mind,
I'd like to use the restroom.

240
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,955
Uh, yeah. You don't have to
ask permission to do that.

241
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,874
Why, have you not gone
since you've been here?

242
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,167
I have not.

243
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,922
Well... Well, go. I mean, go.

244
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,051
Denpok, I know you were in Aspen.
Thank you for coming.

245
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,719
Please, have a seat.

246
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,431
I'm not sitting this summer.

247
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,726
Of course. incredible.

248
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,108
What's weighing on you, Gavin?

249
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,485
Jared Dunn quit today to join Pied Piper.

250
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,322
I hate Richard Hendricks,
that little Pied Piper prick.

251
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,826
Ls... Is that wrong?

252
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,954
In the hands of a lesser person, perhaps.

253
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,833
But in the hands of the enlightened,

254
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,794
hate can be a tool for great change.

255
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,631
You're right once again.

256
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,180
Audious, play John Lennon's Imagine.

257
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,391
Cueing John Wayne

258
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,685
In A Mansion. Not found.

259
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,688
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Invalid command.

260
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:57,109
Use the anger, Chela. Use it.

261
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,869
Uh, thanks for sitting down like this,
Gilfoyle. We know it's kind of a little weird.

262
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:12,332
So, um, can you kind of catch me up on
what you see as your role in the company?

263
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,252
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

264
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,549
System architecture.
Networking and security.

265
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,594
No one in this house can touch me on that.

266
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,471
Okay, that's good to know.

267
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,181
But does anyone appreciate that?

268
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,392
While you were busy
minoring in gender studies

269
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,311
and singing a capella at Sarah Lawrence,

270
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,230
I was gaining root access to NSA servers.

271
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,650
I was one click away
from starting a second lranian Revolution.

272
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,068
I actually went to Vassar.

273
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,739
I prevent cross-site scripting.
I monitor for DDOS attacks,

274
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,534
emergency database rollbacks,
and faulty transaction handlings.

275
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,203
The internet... Heard of it?

276
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,497
...transfers half a petabyte
of data every minute.

277
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,249
Do you have any idea how that happens?

278
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,877
All those YouPorn ones and zeroes
streaming directly

279
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,338
to your shitty little smart
phone day after day?

280
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,924
Every dipshit who shits his pants
if he can't get

281
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,384
the new dubstep Skrillex remix
in under 12 seconds?

282
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,137
It's not magic, it's talent and sweat.

283
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,266
People like me ensuring your packets
get delivered un-sniffed.

284
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,518
So what do I do?

285
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,646
I make sure that one bad config
on one key component

286
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,731
doesn't bankrupt the
entire fucking company.

287
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,358
That's what the fuck I do.

288
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,611
Um, that's basically what I told him.

289
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,113
Listen, wherever we end up here,

290
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,284
I just wanna say that I feel
I should get more equity than Dinesh.

291
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,995
I know Gilfoyle probably
came in here and puked out

292
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,247
a bunch of tech specs,

293
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,999
three-fourths of which
are total horse-shit.

294
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,335
Did he bring up the
lranian Revolution thing?

295
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,754
Yeah, those words mean nothing.

296
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,381
But here's a fact,

297
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm the only one of these clowns
that can code in Java.

298
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,136
And I write sleek, performant,
low-overhead Scala code

299
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,139
with higher order functions
that will run on anything.

300
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,600
Period. End of sentence.

301
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,687
So, basically, I think
whatever equity I get,

302
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,815
it should reflect that
I contribute more than Gilfoyle.

303
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,736
- This is weird.
- I know, right? it's...

304
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,155
- Everybody's been doing it.
- Gilfoyle did this?

305
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,783
It's just a formality to get me caught up.

306
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,828
So what makes you of value
to the Pied Piper team?

307
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,913
Um...

308
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,415
Programming, I guess.

309
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:21,628
Pretty good at code,
develop algorithms, so forth.

310
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,506
Different from the type of
algorithm Richard created?

311
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,009
Well, yeah. Like, not as good.

312
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,137
Richard's a 10X-er. I'm,
like, barely an X-er.

313
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,015
I kinda suck.

314
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,850
...Smoked you. And now...

315
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,894
- Don't be a dick.
- Mushroom stamp!

316
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,356
- You're being a dick.
- Oh, there you go. Show that to your mom.

317
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,109
Mushroom stamp! That's great.

318
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,779
Hey, what do you guys
think about this Jared?

319
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:48,864
He's shit, right?

320
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,532
No, he's pretty sharp.

321
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,993
Yeah, he does shit that
no one else in the house can do.

322
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,957
Yeah, but he's a know-it-all.
I don't think there's room in here for him.

323
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,158
Well, there will be
after Richard gets rid of Big Head.

324
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,125
Wait, Richard's getting
rid of Big Head? Why?

325
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,793
Listen, we all love Big Head.

326
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,254
But the truth is, he's not
as good of a coder as I am,

327
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,180
not as good at system architecture
as Gilfoyle,

328
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,176
not as good at being a prick as you,
no offense.

329
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,700
He's a lightweight at everything.
Brings nothing to the table.

330
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,307
Him getting points would be
a big "fuck you" to all of us.

331
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,770
- But he's a great guy.
- Great guy. But useless.

332
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,564
Yeah, he is a great guy.

333
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,233
Not like that Jared. Huh.

334
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,527
At least we can all agree on that.

335
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,863
Yeah, I don't know.

336
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,991
Me and Richard have just always
been in this together, you know?

337
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,201
Together, right.

338
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,663
But to be clear, Richard created
the algorithm on his own, yes?

339
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,598
Oh, yeah, I had nothing to do with that.

340
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,460
- He's my best friend.
- That's true.

341
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,546
Yes. The camaraderie is quite apparent.

342
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:51,968
But Peter Gregory demanded
a lean, ruthless business plan,

343
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:56,098
and I don't think that the CEO of Microsoft
has a paid best friend.

344
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,393
Sergey Brin does.
Larry doesn't do shit.

345
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,477
See.

346
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,815
What if Big Head is sort of
like a floating utility player?

347
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,608
Like a jack of all trades.

348
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:12,572
But, by his own admission,
he's really more like a master of none.

349
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,282
That's true. That is true.

350
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,411
Which is not something
you'd generally reward with several points

351
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,997
in what may someday be
a multi-billion dollar company.

352
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,291
This will never fly with Peter Gregory.

353
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,046
I would not want to be Richard right now.

354
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,132
Having to tell Big Head that he's out.

355
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,175
This is gonna sound super mean,

356
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,720
but the other night he was sleeping,
I was just staring at his face.

357
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,140
All I could think was,
"He's utterly useless.

358
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,726
"Big Head is a man with zero purpose."

359
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,815
- Oh, hi. Hi, Big Head.
- Hey.

360
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,941
How's it going?

361
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,319
It's super good right now.

362
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,656
Um, I'm just going to maybe
go for a bike ride real fast

363
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,076
and clear my... head.

364
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,995
I'll see you.

365
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,997
- Bike safe.
- Yeah, enjoy it.

366
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,666
That was nice, guys. He heard everything.

367
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,293
That doesn't make it not true.

368
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,296
I mean, come on, Richard.
As far as Pied Piper is concerned,

369
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,840
he's as pointless as Mass Effect 3's
multiple endings.

370
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,510
I mean, he's a completely useless
appendage, and we all know it.

371
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,931
- Oh, hey, man.
- Forgot my water bottle.

372
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:29,024
Just gonna grab it, and then probably
walk right back through one more time.

373
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,402
I mean, Mass Effect 3?

374
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,112
Harsh.

375
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,198
I didn't mean for him to hear it,
but it was true.

376
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,701
I mean, we all called him a great guy,
but he didn't overhear any of that.

377
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,871
It's been 12 hours.

378
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,290
God damn. He's still not answering.

379
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,710
You know...
I'm actually kind of worried about him.

380
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,380
You know, if he's gone,
like, really, truly gone,

381
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,342
in a way that kind of solves your problem.

382
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,135
I mean, like, if he's dead...

383
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,304
Are you trying to say
that Big Head might be dead?

384
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,306
That doesn't help at all.
How is that helping?

385
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,392
I'm just saying that that's a possible
thing that could've happened to him.

386
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,769
It could happen to anybody.

387
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,105
And in this case, at least
something good came out of it.

388
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,440
What's the good part?

389
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,400
You don't have to have
an awkward conversation.

390
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,611
That's scary. Should we go look for him?

391
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,031
I mean, I agree with these guys.
Jared's just not working out.

392
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,574
What?

393
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,326
Um, Richard...

394
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,204
I don't wanna be too assertive here,

395
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,249
but I could use your input
on a few things for the business plan.

396
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,960
Richie, you tried your best.
Just call him, leave a message,

397
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,127
say he's out.

398
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,796
No, that's an asshole move.

399
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,841
Yeah, remember? You need to be an asshole.

400
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,761
I feel bad about saying that thing
about him being dead.

401
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,012
That's not who I am.

402
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,726
- Wait, what is that?
- That's impossible.

403
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,437
NipAlert isn't live yet.

404
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,064
Maybe he's demoing it for someone.

405
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,526
"Mochacino."

406
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,987
He rode his bike to San Jose?

407
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,280
Jared, can I borrow your car?

408
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,198
- Sure.
- I have a car.

409
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,200
What's wrong with my car?

410
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,743
I just have... I don't know.

411
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,288
All right, well, remember to be an asshole.

412
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,792
A real asshole.

413
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,927
Hi, I'm Richard Hendricks.
You did a dance... The dancing at my house.

414
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,721
Your ride's here.

415
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,347
Oh, hey, man.

416
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,141
- Hey.
- Mushroom stamp!

417
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,977
No, come on, dude, not again...

418
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,565
I just wanted to work with
computers and get paid for it.

419
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,110
I didn't want end up fighting with
my roommates over percentage points.

420
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,486
So you're just gonna give up?

421
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,364
On what? This isn't home.

422
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,617
As much as I've tried, it's just not.

423
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:47,203
I mean, what would I have even done
if I didn't have Mochacino's card?

424
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,747
Where would I have gone?

425
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,124
It's fucking pathetic.

426
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,586
Well, Mochacino seemed to like you.
She let you into her apartment.

427
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,379
I had to give her my bike.

428
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,590
She's just like everyone else
in this goddamn valley.

429
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,843
Watching the bottom line.
Fuck it, dude. I'm done here.

430
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,470
What about NipAlert?

431
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:08,808
Mochacino shows her tits for a living,
and even she was uncomfortable using it.

432
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:13,104
She said it was sexist.
She's right. it's actually perverted.

433
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,608
I made a perverted, sexist, useless thing.

434
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,279
And, you know, everybody's right, man,

435
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,448
there's nothing for me to do on Pied Piper.

436
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,993
I think over time,
maybe we could redefine your role.

437
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,370
Come on, dude.

438
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,646
Unless you can tell me right now
what I can do for Pied Piper

439
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,542
that no one else can, I'm gone.

440
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,589
- Yeah.
- Uh...

441
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,842
I'm going to go get the stuff
out of my cube at Hooli,

442
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,553
and then I'm getting the
hell out of this town.

443
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,600
So this is goodbye then?

444
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,313
I mean, I'll see you
back at the house, man.

445
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,315
I gotta, like, pack and stuff.

446
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,483
Oh, totally.

447
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,903
I'm going to take the train, I think,
just do some thinking...

448
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,571
Okay. All right, see you.

449
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,410
- The train is this way... l just...
- Oh. I was gonna say.

450
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,953
Big Head.

451
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,290
Whatever shit you're about to dump
on my head, you can save it, okay?

452
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,417
I'm not in the mood.

453
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,293
Dude, I just wanted to tell you
that Gavin Belson

454
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,503
wants to talk to you about something.

455
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,798
- Oh, okay. Fuck you.
- No. Seriously.

456
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,760
Gavin Belson said he wants
to speak to Nelson Bighetti?

457
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,054
Yeah, that's what I just said.

458
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,765
Come on.

459
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,102
Okay...

460
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,443
I'm awake! I'm awake.

461
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,904
- What?
- No, no, I wasn't.

462
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:49,367
I was sleeping. I'm sorry for sleeping
and for lying about it.

463
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,327
For both. No good.

464
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,871
What happened?

465
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,873
Did you fire Big Head?

466
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,500
Uh, no. Not yet. I don't know. Sort of.

467
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,503
So, um, do I include him
in the cap table or not?

468
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,921
It's basically good to go.

469
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,217
Uh, no, he's out. Wait... I don't know.

470
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,179
Actually, I just need to close
my eyes for a little bit. Okay?

471
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,348
Richard, it's T-minus four hours
until presentation time.

472
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,059
Are you gonna fire Big Head or not?

473
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,643
I don't know. Uh...

474
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:17,979
I'm just very tired.

475
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,398
Okay? I'm just gonna go get some water...

476
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:24,569
Richard, stop being a fucking pussy
and start being an asshole.

477
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,622
Fine! You want me to be an asshole,
I'll be an asshole.

478
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,708
I'll be an asshole to you
and you and you and you

479
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,251
and Peter-fucking-Gregory!

480
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,505
Okay? Fuck all of you. Big Head stays!

481
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,591
You know, if I wanted to be a sell out,
I'd have done that already.

482
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,469
I'd be on a beach somewhere
with $10 million in my pocket.

483
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,514
Not in my pocket, in a bank account.

484
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,392
Okay? This is my company.
It was my idea, and we do what I say.

485
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,687
And what I say is, Jared,
put Big Head in the business plan.

486
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,564
He gets the same amount of
shares as everybody else.

487
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,192
Big Head, you're not going home, man.

488
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,653
Uh, you're right. I'm not.

489
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,781
Gavin Belson just offered me
a huge promotion

490
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,076
for 600 grand a year
to steal me away from you guys.

491
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,120
- What?
- Yeah. For revenge.

492
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,412
Because you took Jared.

493
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,249
So you're like the VP of spite?

494
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,417
But you have to do me a favor, Richard,

495
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:25,046
if you run into Gavin ever you have to
act really upset about it, you know?

496
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,549
Oh, but I am upset.

497
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,968
Okay? What the fuck?

498
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,345
I kind of just went out on a limb
for you here, man.

499
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,390
Sorry, man, but this is huge for me.

500
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,600
I'm going to move out, get my own place.

501
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,228
In light of this new information,

502
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,605
who gets Big Head's equity?

503
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,274
Should I get half of his shares...

504
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,067
I do. I get it.

505
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,027
Okay? I get all of it!

506
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,324
Big Head, man,
congratulations on the job, really.

507
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,411
But if you'll excuse me,
I have to go lock down

508
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,746
a motherfucking business plan.
Jared, you're with me.

509
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,420
What an asshole.

510
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,715
Yeah. What an asshole.

511
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,471
Next.

512
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,892
- Hi.
- Deposit?

513
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,059
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,483
$200,000 from Peter Gregory?

515
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,776
Mmm-hmm.

516
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,987
- Wow.

517
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,450
Sorry.

518
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,745
Hello?

519
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,914
Dude, they're taking your code apart.

520
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,540
- What?
- Yeah,

521
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,377
did you give those brogrammer guys access
to a player download or something?

522
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,962
Oh, shit.

523
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,216
They probably hacked the prototype
and decompiled the compression library.

524
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,177
Well, they've got it now, man.

525
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,721
They're gonna reverse-engineer
a version as close as they can

526
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,181
without getting sued.

527
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,747
Wait, wait, are you sure about this?

528
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,893
Yeah, dude, Gavin wants
to beat you to market.

529
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,938
He wants to make sure no other investor
in the Valley offers you a dime.

530
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,648
That is not good.

531
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,984
They're calling it Nucleus,
whatever the fuck that means.

532
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:13,988
Shit. Sorry, dude, I can't be
talking to you like this. Later.

533
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,490
Yeah.

534
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,117
"Nucleus"?

535
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:22,705
Excuse me. This check is made out
to "Pied Piper incorporated."

536
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,124
- Do you have an SS-4?
- A what?

537
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,253
Ls Pied Piper a corporation
registered with the IRS?

538
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,171
I can't deposit that
into a personal account.

539
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,007
I don't know.

540
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,343
Ls that something maybe
you could help me with?

541
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,719
No, sir.

542
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,181
Buddy, come on.

543
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,142
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

544
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,270
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Okay.

545
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,523
Next.
