1
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,360
Whoo. Yeah.

2
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,780
Somebody make some
motherfucking noise in here!

3
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,530
Fuck these people.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,210
Man, this place is unbelievable.

5
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,760
Fucking Goolybib, man.

6
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,590
Those guys build a
mediocre piece of software,

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,510
that might be worth something someday,

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,260
and now they live here.

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,050
There's money flying
all over Silicon Valley

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,550
but none of it ever seems to hit us.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,310
What the hell are you eating?

12
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,810
Liquid shrimp. It's 200 dollars a quart.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,650
Wylie Dufresne made it.

14
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,990
How does it taste?

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,480
Like how I would imagine cum tastes.

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,280
You guys taking it all in?

17
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,400
Because this is what it looks like when

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,990
Google acquires your company
for over 200 million dollars.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,540
Look Dustin Moskovitz.

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,660
Elon Musk. Eric Schmidt.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,340
Whatever the fuck the guy's
name is who created Photrio.

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,840
I mean, Kid Rock is the
poorest person here.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,220
Apart from you guys.

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,550
Ok, there's 40 billion dollars

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,750
of net worth, walking around this party.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,920
And you guys are standing
around drinking shrimp

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,930
and talking about what cum tastes like.

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,350
Yeah, I heard that. You
guys live in my Incubator

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,150
you've got to network. That's
why I brought you here.

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,860
I got us in here.

31
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,320
Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.

32
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,990
Yeah, but I drove.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,360
Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.

34
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,530
It's amazing how the men
and women at these things

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,210
always separate like this.

36
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,950
Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley
ends up like a hasidic wedding.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,540
Not even the Goolybib guys
were talking to girls.

38
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,370
They don't have to, Big Head.

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,210
This house talks to girls.

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,430
Hello! Whoo!

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,470
I got seven words for you.

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,730
I love

43
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,730
Goolybib's integrated-

44
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,470
multi-platform-functionality!

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,640
Yeah! Whoo!

46
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,910
But seriously,

47
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,570
you know, a few days ago, when we
were sitting down with Barack Obama,

48
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,910
I turned to these guys and said,

49
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,950
"ok, you know, we're making a lot of money.

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,320
And yes, we're disrupting digital media.

51
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,210
But most importantly

52
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,910
we're making the world a better place.

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,260
Through constructing elegant

54
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,000
hierarchies for maximum code
reuse and extensibility."

55
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,810
So everyone.

56
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,760
Here's to many more
nights just like this one.

57
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,350
Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,270
What a dick.

59
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:14,340
☯Synced & Corrected by Seppuku17☯
❃www.addic7ed.com❃

60
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,330
Big Head, there is a personal ad section

61
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,620
on this asperger site.

62
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,370
Holy shit, this one is looking for

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,340
a "relationship that has
the potential to become

64
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,870
sexual in nature."

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,670
Boy, is she on the spectrum.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,190
She can't even make eye
contact with the camera.

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,880
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

68
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,380
- Solo.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,980
We need to talk about Pied Piper.

70
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,640
What about it? The
website's up and running,

71
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,110
I'm just redesigning the
compression. It just needs users.

72
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,140
Yeah, no shit.

73
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,780
But even if somebody wanted to use it

74
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,560
they wouldn't be able to figure
out how to. It's incomprehensible.

75
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,980
Now, Richard, when you pitched me

76
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,320
Pied Piper you said it was
gonna be, "the Google of music."

77
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,150
Which is a really rad
way to pitch something.

78
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,570
I mean, I liked it. I thought
it had "applications".

79
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,070
No, it has all that.
Look, when it blows up,

80
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,460
and it will once it reaches
a critical mass of users,

81
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,660
Pied Piper will be able
to search the whole world

82
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,160
of recorded music to find out
if there's a match to see if

83
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,170
you're infringing on any
copyrighted material.

84
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,840
So, if you're a song writer or a band...

85
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,220
Ok, first of all, nobody gives a shit

86
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,510
about stealing other people's music, ok?

87
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,390
Everybody involved in the music industry

88
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,810
is either stealing it or sharing it.

89
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,840
They're all a bunch of
assholes, especially Radiohead.

90
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,230
- Look, Richard...
- No.

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
Yeah, they're assholes.

92
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,770
Now, look, Richard, if
you want to live here,

93
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,030
you've got to deliver.

94
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,020
I can't have dead weight
at my Incubator, ok?

95
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,360
Either that, or show some
promise for fuck's sake.

96
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,240
Like NipAlert, Big Head's app.

97
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,030
It gives you the location of
a woman with erect nipples.

98
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,700
Now, that's something people want.

99
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,880
Richard, you need to get
in touch with humanity.

100
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,120
When I sold my company, Aviato,

101
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,920
I wanted to give back. That's
why I started this place,

102
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,590
to do something big. To make a difference.

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,510
You know, like Steve.

104
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,470
Uh, Jobs or Wozniak?

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,630
Steve Jobs or Steve...

106
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,890
Oh, I heard you.

107
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,350
- Which one?
- Jobs.

108
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,610
I mean, Jobs was a poser.
He didn't even write code.

109
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,610
You just disappeared up your own asshole.

110
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,370
- You know that? You did.
- Well, technically...

111
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,030
Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,620
He knew how to package the
ideas, but it was Wozniak that...

113
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,410
What is Hooli? Excellent question.

114
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,050
Hooli isn't just another high tech company.

115
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,130
Hooli isn't just about software.

116
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,670
Hooli. Hooli is about people.

117
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,420
Hooli is about innovative technology

118
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,170
that makes a difference,

119
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,310
transforming the world as we know it.

120
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,430
Making the world a better place,

121
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,730
through minimal message
oriented transport layers.

122
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,020
I firmly believe we can
only achieve greatness

123
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,020
if first we achieve goodness.

124
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,780
Erlich is gonna kick me out.

125
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,740
And I can't afford to pay rent here.

126
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,250
It's insane. $2800 a month,

127
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,670
$4500 a month... With five people.

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,200
Jesus! Why is it so expensive here?

129
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,630
Look at this place, it's a shithole.

130
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,040
Uh-oh. Here's another one.

131
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,640
Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.

132
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,470
There she goes.

133
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,980
Oh God, the marketing team is
having another bike meeting.

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,770
Douchebags.

135
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,320
Yup, another day inside the
Gavin Belson cult compound.

136
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,940
Hey, did you hear what
Peter Gregory is doing?

137
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,730
You mean buying that island in the Pacific?

138
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,370
No, he's building one actually.

139
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,950
Baller.

140
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,990
Anyway, he's also offering a hundred k

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,820
to people willing to skip
or drop out of college

142
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,240
to pursue their idea.

143
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,540
I don't know what happened to that guy,

144
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,000
but he really hates college.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Anyway, he's doing a TED
talks in Palo Alto tonight.

146
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,500
- We should try to get in.
- I dropped out of college.

147
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,720
Maybe I should re-enroll
and drop out again.

148
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,600
Try and get the money.

149
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,560
Brogrammers.

150
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,850
Oh, no, no.

151
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,010
Hey, uh, a double macchiato for me, dude.

152
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,780
Yeah.

153
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,520
Hey, Rico, you been working out?

154
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,540
No. No, I have not.

155
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,520
I don't have time to even if I wanted to.

156
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm too busy working on my website.

157
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,780
Uh, I just, I don't want to
end up being a Hooli lifer.

158
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,360
You know, working here forever.

159
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,530
Yeah, working for the most
innovative company in the world,

160
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,790
with top pay and vested stock options.

161
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,550
I can totally see why
you wouldn't want that.

162
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,090
Yeah, you're like an
artist. An entrepreneur.

163
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,720
An iconoclast.

164
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,630
I don't know, maybe.

165
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,720
Dude, we're just messing with you.

166
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,230
But we really want to
help you with your site.

167
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,050
What's it called?

168
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,720
Pied Piper.

169
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,360
- Dude, sounds amazing.
- Yeah.

170
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,560
Why don't you shoot it over to
us and we'll give it a look.

171
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,240
Maybe we can help.

172
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,200
- Uh, really?
- Yeah.

173
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,570
Ok, yeah.

174
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,040
I mean it's always good
to have more eyes on it.

175
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,490
It's... sent it.

176
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,960
Oh, you're making fun of me.

177
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,330
- Dude, no.
- No, you are.

178
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,130
- Aw, Ricky, man.
- Ricky. Ricky, come back.

179
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,840
It's actually Richard, so that's...

180
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,920
- Pied wiper.
- Wide diaper.

181
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,590
Gates, Ellison,

182
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,100
Jobs, Dell.

183
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,850
All dropped out of college.

184
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,270
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

185
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,360
because of drop outs.

186
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,780
College... has become a cruel

187
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,960
expensive joke on the poor

188
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,700
and the middle class

189
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,590
that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

190
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,710
- The bloated administrators.
- You are a dangerous man,

191
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,430
spewing ignorance!

192
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,850
I don't think so.

193
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm just saying people
should trust themselves

194
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,890
more than a system that happily
churns out unemployed debtors

195
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,220
and provides dubious value.

196
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,450
The true value of a college
education is intangible.

197
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,450
The true value of snake-oil
is intangible as well.

198
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,600
Fascist.

199
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,740
Anything?

200
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,740
The usual riffs on twitter and instagram.

201
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,170
Nothing I'd fund.

202
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,470
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?

203
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,580
I have an idea I'd love to
pitch you, if you have time.

204
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,750
Oh.

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,010
Well, that is before I just
give up and go back to college.

206
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,350
Don't! Do not do that.

207
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,020
Go work at Burger King.

208
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,400
Go into the woods and
forage for nuts and berries.

209
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,530
Do not go back to college!

210
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,030
I think I have been played.

211
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,990
Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,360
You have until I fasten
the seat-belt in my car.

213
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,190
Thank you so much.

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,710
Pied Piper is a proprietary
site that lets you find out

215
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,750
if your music is infringing
on any existing copyrights.

216
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,710
So, imagine you were a song writer, ok?

217
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,890
I don't think I could write a song.

218
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,920
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

219
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,960
I don't even think I could say,
"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

220
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,180
Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

221
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,680
Crunching all those songs

222
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,020
to find matches sounds like it would
take incredible processing power.

223
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,970
- I mean...
- Yes.

224
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,220
Yes, it does.

225
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,110
No, no. Its... I made an algorithm.

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,820
Look, why don't you send me a link to
your project and we'll take a look.

227
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,820
Ok, yeah, great.

228
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,290
I put the prototype up on github.

229
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,570
Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

230
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,040
It's like the fable with the kids

231
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,220
and then the rats and the music.

232
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,090
That is a narrow car.

233
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,560
Fucking billionaires.

234
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,770
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

235
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,850
Yes, I do.

236
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,270
You have to download your own media player?

237
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,490
Ahh.

238
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,950
Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

239
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,530
Wait a sec.

240
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,180
What is this file size?

241
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,500
1.2 megabytes? No way.

242
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,540
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

243
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,260
The file size is like, half.

244
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,640
And look how fast this search is.

245
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,940
Holy shit, how did it
find a match that fast?

246
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,140
It's like it's searching compressed files?

247
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,610
No way.

248
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,230
Look at that weissman score.

249
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,980
2.89.

250
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,230
Hey, where have you two been?

251
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,500
We're playing the multi-channel
router team in five minutes.

252
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,710
Ok, how the hell did he do this?

253
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,000
And the compression is totally lossless.

254
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:32,250
And he's somehow figured out a way to
do a search on a compressed data space.

255
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,920
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

256
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,890
And I don't think he even
realizes what he has here.

257
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,850
He's using it for some
silly songwriter app.

258
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,690
All these guys are like that,
they're all about consumer facing.

259
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,560
Right, but you take something like this,

260
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,360
make it business facing
and use it for enterprise?

261
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,030
The applications could be endless.

262
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,570
Hey, I thought you were a satanist?

263
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,910
I'm a LaVeyan Satanist

264
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,700
with some theistic tendencies.

265
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,160
Oh, some theistic tendencies.

266
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,580
Well then, what's with the cross?

267
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,860
It's an upside down cross.

268
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,620
Not from here it isn't.

269
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,510
Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

270
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,260
You should get another tattoo
that says, "this side up" on it.

271
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,890
How does this translate into Farsi?

272
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,510
That's not the language I speak.

273
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,550
Frontier Airlines just
happened to like mine, Aviato.

274
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,800
And that's how I got to where I am.

275
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,390
So... what do you got?

276
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,470
Ok, here it is.

277
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,560
Bit Soup.

278
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,560
It's like alphabet soup but

279
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:39,040
it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.

280
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,160
'Cause it's binary. You know,
binary is just ones and zeroes.

281
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,540
Yeah, I know what binary is.

282
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,040
Jesus Christ! I memorized
the hexadecimal times tables

283
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,330
when I was 14 writing machine code!

284
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,630
Ok. Ask me what nine times f is.

285
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,090
It's fleventyfive.

286
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,220
I do not need you telling
me what binary is,

287
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,190
just like I don't need you thinking
about soup or taking pictures of it.

288
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,970
I need you thinking about
apps, software, websites.

289
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,930
This is Silicon Valley, all right, not...

290
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,320
Paris, Texas.

291
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,220
That's where Campbell's soup is.

292
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,940
It's the Hooli number again.

293
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,440
It's probably those brogrammers.

294
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,660
Can't wait to tell me
how stupid my website is.

295
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,000
Assholes.

296
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,580
Hello, Richard Hendricks.
I'm a total fucking retard.

297
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,950
Uh. Hi, this is Jared
Dunn calling from Hooli.

298
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.

299
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,290
I didn't... hi.

300
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,760
Gavin is very excited about
your Pied Piper application

301
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,600
and we were wondering if you could come in

302
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,350
for a sit-down with us.

303
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,310
- Are you available now.
- Ok.

304
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,150
- Sure. Yes.
- Ok, we'll be here.

305
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,150
Good-bye.

306
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,490
Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

307
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,030
He likes Pied Piper.

308
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,900
- Holy shit.
- I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.

309
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,310
You said it was a shitty idea.

310
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,370
It was a shitty idea.

311
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,980
I'm not sure what it is now.

312
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,200
- What time's the meeting?
- Right now.

313
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,410
I'm gonna need a better shirt.

314
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,740
Holy shit.

315
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,060
What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.

316
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,090
Well, it's like Gavin always says,
"it takes change to make change."

317
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,360
Yeah, I think I've seen
that written around.

318
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,320
- Hey.
- Hi.

319
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,440
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

320
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,030
but you should know he is very
excited to see you, Richard.

321
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,440
He's with his spiritual advisor.

322
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,160
He shouldn't be that much longer.

323
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,530
I'm a VP here and I only get to
see him about ten minutes a month.

324
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,780
But that 10 minutes is just incredible.

325
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,590
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

326
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,710
Have you ever met Gavin before?

327
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,370
- No.
- No?

328
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,050
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

329
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,630
That hardly begins to describe it.

330
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,730
It's weird.

331
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,640
They always travel in groups of five.

332
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,190
These programmers, there's
always a tall skinny white guy,

333
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,360
short skinny Asian guy,

334
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,810
fat guy with a ponytail,

335
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,780
some guy with crazy facial hair

336
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,080
and then an East Indian guy.

337
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,650
It's like they trade guys until
they all have the right group.

338
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,990
You clearly have a great
understanding of humanity.

339
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,460
And Gavin said I'm not humiliating you,

340
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm elevating you.

341
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,420
Ah, Gavin.

342
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,600
This is Richard.

343
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,940
It's Peter Gregory.

344
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,670
Ah, no.

345
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,730
Come on, Big Head.

346
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,350
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

347
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,450
Why are you going that fast?

348
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,620
We've got a meeting with Gavin
Belson. Pick up the pace.

349
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:13,830
- We honestly don't.
- Come on.

350
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,630
I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson's
office right now, Mr. Gregory.

351
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,670
Uh, here he comes, so
can I call you back in...

352
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,600
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

353
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,960
There you are, Richard.

354
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,380
So sorry these gentleman
have kept you waiting.

355
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,850
- That's fine.
- So here's the thing.

356
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,070
I love what you did.

357
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,310
- Really?
- Fill him in, Jared.

358
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,150
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly

359
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,360
the most progressive company in the world.

360
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,900
Part of that is Gavin's
commitment to social justice,

361
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,480
but part of it is his personal commitment

362
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,660
to the people that work at Hooli.

363
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,990
In that spirit Gavin is prepared to
give you a very substantial raise...

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,460
And a promotion to go with it.

365
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,490
I own 10 percent.

366
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,490
He created it while living in my Incubator.

367
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

368
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,010
I don't know what any of that means, but I'll
give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.

369
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,000
We have the reach and the resources
to take what you have done

370
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,970
and push it to the global level.

371
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,090
That is a generous offer.

372
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,680
Shit, sorry. Hello.

373
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,180
Really? No shit, that's...

374
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,860
Uh, yeah, yeah. No here.
It's Peter Gregory.

375
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,410
Not sure how he got my number?

376
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,740
Uh, this is Richard.

377
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,200
I'll give you three million
dollars for it right now!

378
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,750
Ah, Gavin Belson just offered me
three million dollars for Pied Piper.

379
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm prepared to give you three
hundred thousand dollars.

380
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,870
Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...

381
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,630
Did you say thousand dollars?

382
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,340
For ten percent of your company.

383
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,960
Ok, four million.

384
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,280
200 thousand.

385
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,430
- For five percent.
- Huh?

386
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,560
You just went down.

387
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,230
No, you're still valued
at four million dollars.

388
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,610
But you own ninety-five percent of
a potential billion-dollar company.

389
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,250
And not just that, I will
help you build this company.

390
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,030
I will introduce you to
the people you need to know

391
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,370
and provide the counsel that you need.

392
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,790
I will take a small piece, but
the company will belong to you.

393
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,740
Not Gavin Belson.

394
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,590
You have until tomorrow to decide.

395
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,720
Ah, ok.

396
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,640
- Um, you know.
- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

397
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,510
I'm offering you four
million dollars right now.

398
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,260
I'm...

399
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,180
That is a lot of money.

400
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,930
You know, I actually have to...

401
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,280
I've got to go to the bathroom.

402
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,740
I've got to pee.

403
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,190
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

404
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,940
I'll be right back, but right now...

405
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,280
Ok, 10 million.

406
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,960
No. Maybe.

407
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,120
I didn't mean to snap at you.

408
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,870
I'll talk... in a bit.

409
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,910
Won't be long.

410
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,960
Little more about me.

411
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,510
I am the founder of Aviato.

412
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,130
And I own a very small
percentage of Grindr.

413
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,050
It's a men to men dating site

414
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,880
where you can find other
men within 10 miles of you.

415
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,890
Interested in having sexual
intercourse in a public restroom.

416
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,090
In the homosexual community
there's sometimes anonymous...

417
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,440
I know what Grindr is.

418
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,830
I have gay friends.

419
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,460
So you will survive.

420
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,160
It's just a garden variety panic attack.

421
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,790
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

422
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,660
We see people like you all the time.

423
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,380
- Really?
- Yes.

424
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,800
It's just I have to make
this decision by tomorrow.

425
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,340
Yeah. You know, a while back,

426
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,590
we had a guy in here in almost
the exact same situation,

427
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,470
"take the money or keep the company."

428
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,640
What happened?

429
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,430
Well, a couple months later

430
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,810
he was brought into the ER with
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

431
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,680
I guess he really regretted
not taking that money.

432
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,900
He shot himself because
he turned down the money?

433
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,570
Yeah.

434
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,870
Or no, he took the money.

435
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,860
Or no.

436
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,240
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

437
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,870
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

438
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,660
he regretted it so much that
he ended up shooting himself.

439
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,000
- And now he's blind.
- He's blind?

440
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,920
Yeah, just fyi, if you're
ever gonna shoot yourself,

441
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,540
don't hold the gun up to your temple, ok?

442
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,670
Because that just basically just took out

443
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,210
both of his optic nerves and then,

444
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,790
you know, half of his face.

445
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,510
And then his wife left
him, because, you know.

446
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,550
- Yikes.
- Right.

447
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,130
He may have been a genius programmer

448
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,890
but not so much in human anatomy.

449
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,050
Or decision making, for that matter.

450
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,390
Now he's got to live with all that

451
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
and whatever terrible decision
he made about the money.

452
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,530
Uh. And what do I do if I feel
another panic attack coming on.

453
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,030
Would you be interested in a device

454
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,620
that links up to your
smartphone and it keeps track

455
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,250
of your vitals and it tells
you, even before it's happening,

456
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,040
whether you're having a panic
attack or an actual heart attack?

457
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,240
Yeah, that sounds great.

458
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,460
You would, right? Ok, that's great news.

459
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,660
Because it's still in
prototype phase right now,

460
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,260
but my start-up partners and
I are looking for investors.

461
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,750
Like today. So will you
please let me know...

462
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm going to give you my number.

463
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,930
If you do end up taking
that 10 million dollars

464
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,340
because we could really make
the world a better place.

465
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,320
Whoa! Oh, jeez!

466
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,740
Richard.

467
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,650
Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

468
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,020
- We met outside the TED...
- Yeah, I remember you.

469
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,950
What... how'd you know I was here?

470
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,610
Peter Gregory is invested in a company

471
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,030
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

472
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,800
That's creepy.

473
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,090
You don't know the half of it.

474
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,370
And neither does congress.

475
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,930
- Are you ok?
- Look, I don't want to waste your time.

476
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,460
I think I gotta take the
money from Gavin Belson.

477
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,680
At least this way when
I blow my eyeballs out

478
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,850
I'll have some money left for my family.

479
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,140
Jesus.

480
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,560
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

481
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,990
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

482
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,150
is a compression algorithm that
blew our engineering team away.

483
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,490
And what do you think Hooli
is going to do with it?

484
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,620
I don't know. That's their business.

485
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,070
This is your baby.

486
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,490
Do you even realize the
impact that a compression

487
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,540
this good could have on the world?

488
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,910
Getting any file on your
mobile phone in an instant.

489
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,130
Navigation data for self-driving cars,

490
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,500
mobile medical imagery,

491
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,080
all transmitting with no quality loss.

492
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,250
This is game-changing.

493
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,840
Don't you want to be in the
driver's seat when that happens?

494
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,520
You really want to just turn it
all over to Hooli and walk away?

495
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,770
Well, you are not making
this easier for me.

496
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,190
I'm not trying to.

497
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,740
I mean you're actually making it worse.

498
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,270
My hands are tingling. I have
this metal taste in my mouth.

499
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,940
Actually, I can't go back in
there, so I'm going to go home.

500
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,660
- Let me give you a ride home.
- Good to see you again.

501
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,420
Uh, ok. Thanks.

502
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,500
Dude, where have you been?

503
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,040
Why won't you answer your phone?

504
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,880
Man, this has grown way beyond angellist.

505
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,380
Andreesen, elevation and like a bunch of
other seed funds are piling onto this thing.

506
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,870
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

507
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
He's out of control.

508
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,300
Yeah.

509
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,220
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200k

510
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,720
and built our own company?

511
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,060
I'm sorry. You said we.

512
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,270
Who's that in reference to exactly?

513
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,470
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

514
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,110
I mean, right now Pied
Piper just does audio,

515
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,030
but I'm thinking of ways to
compress images, video...

516
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,910
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.

517
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,610
Maybe this could be huge.

518
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,740
Look, guys, for thousands of years

519
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,240
guys like us have gotten
the shit kicked out of us.

520
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,460
But now, for the first time,
we are living in an era

521
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,540
where we can be in
charge and build empires.

522
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,330
We could be the vikings of our day.

523
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,470
- Vikings?
- How are you feeling?

524
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,550
You look super fucked up to be honest.

525
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,920
Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

526
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,590
So you're really about to go tell Erlich that
he's not going to get his one million dollars?

527
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,760
Yeah, I don't want to be
there when you do that.

528
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,270
I would like to be there when you do that.

529
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,350
No, just stay here, please.

530
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,350
Hey.

531
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,940
Um, so, I've been thinking about

532
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,110
this whole Peter Gregory,
Gavin Belson thing.

533
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,780
And, um, I think I'm going
to go with Peter Gregory.

534
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,790
- Uh, which I know means...
- Richard.

535
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,060
I know that you look at me, and see
a guy who has it all figured out.

536
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,130
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

537
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,550
When I sold Aviato,

538
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,350
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

539
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,490
the universal respect of all the ladies.

540
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,310
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

541
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,820
Not a literal hole like you would find

542
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,980
in some babies with congenital diseases,

543
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,980
but a metaphorical hole.

544
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,480
I guess that hole is the "what if".

545
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,280
What if I didn't sell?

546
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,120
I'll never know.

547
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,820
And so I guess what I'm
saying to you now is,

548
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,070
you're like me, Richard.

549
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,160
You want to build something

550
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,880
and see it through.

551
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,250
So, just to be clear.

552
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,420
You're all right with
me saying no to a deal

553
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,500
that will net you a
million dollars outright?

554
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,350
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

555
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,670
I'm excited about it.

556
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,230
Let's see how high this
rocket can fly, partner.

557
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,180
Ok. Great.

558
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,650
That's great.

559
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,270
Not partners, exactly.

560
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,260
But everything else is great.

561
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,900
Call it what you want.

562
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,530
Always blue,
always blue, always blue,

563
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,280
always blue, always blue, always blue,

564
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,170
always blue, always...

565
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,950
Oh! That was a yellow.

566
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,260
What was that, 17?

567
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,090
- Pretty good.
- Hey, guys...

568
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,680
Guys, can I just kind of
say something real quick?

569
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,050
I know it's stupid but, um...

570
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,430
I just want to say, uh,

571
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,350
I'd like for this company
to be different than Hooli

572
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,230
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

573
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,440
Like, let's like not turn
this into a corporate cult

574
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,730
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats

575
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,440
that are actually mandatory.

576
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,450
And claiming to make the world
a better place all the time.

577
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,730
Let's, uh, let's just think different.

578
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,150
Don't think different. That's Apple.

579
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,290
Uh, umm...

580
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,070
Let's just... Let's just do it.

581
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,880
- That's Nike, man.
- I know that's nike.

582
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,740
- Yeah.
- Uh...

583
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,920
Fuck it. I don't know.

584
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,710
Let's just make it...
Let's just make it happen.

585
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,170
Yeah, agreed.

586
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,430
To his beneficence.

587
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,920
Peter Gregory?

588
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,590
- The Dark Lord.
- Of course, The Dark Lord.

589
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,760
Big Head.

590
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,600
God, he's worse high.

591
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,990
Always blue, always blue,
always blue, always blue...

592
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:23,200
